# CodeChef-Interview-HorrorGame
 
The idea behind the game is that you are a priest who has to exorcize a house. The goal of the game is to collect all the points in the house to light up the map. In future I want to add interaction between the player and the enemies, more maps, different upgrades like increased field of view and speed. I have also added the links for my other games which I have uploaded:
